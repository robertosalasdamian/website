Roberto Salas is a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Northwestern University. His research interests lie in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Cognition Science, and Education. He is member of the Qualitative Reasoning Group; he is currently researching on how to build an Analogy Coaching System under the guidance of Kenneth Forbus. 

Roberto has ten years of work experience leading transformation projects in companies in the energy and mining sectors. These transformation projects involve the deployment of management systems to change a company's culture, the deployment of new technologies (automation, artificial intelligence), and the strategy to train employees to learn these new technologies. 

By leading these projects across nine countries, Roberto observed the need to develop innovative learning environments that help people to learn faster new technologies. He is interested in researching the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop teaching and learning solutions such as intelligent tutoring systems, customized learning, and teacher support systems.

Finally, Roberto has two main hobbies. He enjoys cycling; his most challenging route was to cross the Andes at an altitude of 4800 meters. He also likes taking pictures of landscapes, especially during the sunrise and sunset.
