In recent decades, we have seen an accelerating development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, big data, robotics, and others. These technologies are impacting almost every aspect of our lives. The future workplace will require that people not only become familiar and comfortable working in a more digital society but also able to learn new concepts quickly. To prepare current students for these changes, educational organizations need to provide them with new learning strategies and make sure that most of them are familiar with STEM topics.

Studies in cognitive psychology have shown that analogy is a powerful instrument to learn new concepts. Mastering how to properly use analogies can help students develop learning strategies, using past experiences to understand new information. On the other side, studies have demonstrated that early engagement in STEM activities could boost childrenâ€™s interests in STEM.

Taking into account the impact of analogies in learning and the importance of early STEM engagement, I am proposing to develop an analogy coach system with two main features: 1) it will use a sketch-based system that will ask students to make analogies to compare and reason about two sketches; and based on their answers, the system will provide feedback and guidance so students could progressively master the use of analogies, and 2) to coach students in analogies, the proposed system will use a corpus of examples in biomechanics, so students will have the opportunity to learn about different STEM topics. The key mission of this research is to develop educational software that could equip students with the necessary tools to face the challenges of the future.
